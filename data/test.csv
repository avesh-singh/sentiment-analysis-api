933,@SouthwestAir Customer service said it was a known problem that they were using same confirmation numbers for domestic and international,0

935,@AmericanAir on hold again....estimated 2 hr hold,0
936,@AmericanAir you have such a confusing web site/complicated ordering process. This is why I typically fly @SouthwestAir.,0
937,"@united Honestly, I stopped trying to report things via website. Now I just laugh. Flights work. Miles accrue. I'm sure it's just cosmetic.",1
938,@united you are easily the worst company I have ever experienced. You have lost someone's personal possessions &amp; you couldn't care less!....,0
939,@SouthwestAir not to mention I now have to sit in the airport for 4 hours. You've ruined my trip. I am not happy and want compensation.,0
940,@united can you you think about hiring some baggage attendants at EWR? Been waiting for bags for 1 hr. United = overcharged&amp;underserved,0
941,@AmericanAir Aww cool! It's nice to know they are still up above my head then. One of my faves.,1

996,@AmericanAir - And @AirSouthwest  had a flight from Chicago to Buffalo about an hour before our flight -- do they not care about safety?,0
997,@USAirways It's not double booked. I spoke with CS and we've got a plan to fix this. It's still an amateur mistake that should never happen.,0

1384,@USAirways - delayed 1851. Need an extra 5 min to make 1769. Would appreciate a little help again this week.,0
1385,@AmericanAir The issue is the lack of consideration of an announcement made so Late Flight when the gate agent had been there for over an hour.,0
1386,@AmericanAir it's taken care of already. I've come to expect this level of horrible service from you time and time again,0
1387,"@united Hi JH, my experience with United has been entirely disgusting but yes, I'd like assistance in getting compensated for my bag.",0

1393,@SouthwestAir Roger wilco.,0
1394,"@USAirways worst airline ever....left without luggage for 7 days, submit $700 expenses and they offer a refund of $297? #badservice",0

1397,"@USAirways Nightmarish customer service. Further to that, as an elite member, I'm appalled.",0
1398,@united I'm on snowy roads to BWI. I Just called MileagePlus &amp; told flight was Cancelled Flighted 1 1/2 hours ago. I rcvd no notification. Pls help,0
1399,@united no it weighed 45.5 and it was the only checked bag,0
1400,@united @danahajek : United's CEO has decided to outsource and or push out more and more of their skilled and loyal employees..lack of staff,0
1401,@JetBlue No worries. Delay was minor and dealt with nicely. It was captain of flight 2324 by the way.,1
1402,@USAirways flight 437 PHX&gt;ORD.  Lead FA Bill is the most professional FA I have seen in 9 years of flying USAir. I have no AB cards. :-(,1
1403,@USAirways why would you not give us the option to get off the plane instead of sit on it for an hour and a half when you knew at the gate,0
1404,@USAirways Thank you!!! This whole crew has rocked through bad weather and diversion. Pilot keeping us well informed. #customerservice,1
1405,@united Yes. Did file a claim as soon as the carousel stopped without my bag on it. Got an email that its found but not sched for delivery,0
1406,@USAirways any update on this flight?It's more than three hours delayed. Thank you.,0
1407,@AmericanAir thanks. They did not charge anything in the end so all is good.,1
1408,@USAirways yes it landed at 11:40am. Should not take another 12+ hours to go 40 min drive. Was assured I would have this am.,0
1409,@AmericanAir Got my bags this morning! Thanks!,1
1410,@united. Is it reasonable to wait 45 mins for the bag you made me check because the flight staff couldn't police the overhead bins?,0
1411,@AmericanAir I would purchase it if I was there by choice but you guys Cancelled Flightled my flight and have me stuck at DFW for 7 hours!,0
1412,@JetBlue I am heading to JFK now just on principle alone to deal w my lost &amp; damaged bag. #jetblue #jetbluesucks #jfk #badservice #fail,0

1417,@USAirways yup 1:34 minutes was my limit of waiting on hold so thanks for nothing,0
1418,@USAirways why let passengers on board when there was an issue? Over an hour &amp; the pilot doesn't know when we'll leave.,0
1419,@united I'm asking if you can simplify the communications- thx,0
1420,@SouthwestAir this was the 3rd Cancelled Flightlation in 2 days due to weather in Nashville. 3 trips to the airport. Each time communicated Late Flight by SW,0

1433,"@united I'm saying I made the flight but with poor/non-communication, unaccounted for lost time &amp; lots of frustrated flyers standing around",0
1434,@AmericanAir and it's not a inconvenience it is a disaster. It's A $500 phone bill from you that you refuse to pay,0
1435,@united LHR arrival lounge #fail. Waited 20 mins for shower then left to find hotel. U know how many passengers u carry. Planning???,0
1436,@JetBlue note the time this was taken (now at 906 am) and flight still listed as on time for 910 when I'm not onboard http://t.co/zvfmxnuELJ,0

1443,"@JetBlue Very disappointed with the lack of compassion from your baggage services dept. I nearly had to beg get just for a ""courtesy report""",0
1444,@SouthwestAir flight #211pilot spilled his tea on the radio! Yay for delays! Almost an hour now!,0
1445,@SouthwestAir can't fly in precipitation and @Delta has planes that don't work after 5. 3rd airline had better be a charm tomorrow.,0
1446,@united I was originally trying to share details but the link Jimmy Samartzis Vice President - Customer Experience sent me expired.,0
1447,"@USAirways That is the height of rudeness, and without question the worst customer service I have ever experienced.",0
1448,@AmericanAir Oh yea? That's it? C'mon buddy! Bring your special friend @united to the conversation - they seem to be doing NOTHING AT ALL,0
1449,.@united This flight attendant was extremely helpful to a woman who had a hard time walking. Very touching!,1

1463,@USAirways where are my bags?,0
1464,@JetBlue so the prefference option is not something that you honor? So why having it as one of the services if not applied?,0
1465,@USAirways since when does a maintenance problem and missing flight crew equal delayed due to weather? I'm confused since we had sunny skies,0
1466,@JetBlue just called that number and left message. Are you at to pass along message to team too?,0
